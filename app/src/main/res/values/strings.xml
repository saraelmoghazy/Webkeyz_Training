    <string name="hippoDetails">Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it - well, maybe they dont fall in love but they do procreate, so can we estimate how many animals are born every day across the world?
That was the question posed by a listener to the BBCs More or Less programme, a show which aims to make sense of the numbers that inform our lives.
First things first, what do we mean by the term animal? The Oxford English Dictionary defines an animal as a living organism which feeds on organic matter, typically having specialised sense organs and nervous system and able to respond rapidly to stimuli.
So thats mammals and non-mammals, vertebrates and invertebrates, animals that hatch, and animals that have live births.</string>
